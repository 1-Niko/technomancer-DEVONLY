Technically these atlases are useless now, since their object is not, nor will it ever be in the game.
Still though, even if they have no use here, I don't have the heart to remove them yet
Especially not with all the effort it took to make them

So, feel free to share them around! They won't last forever, so make backups if you feel like it.
And thanks for enjoying the mod enough to look through the files, it really warms my heart <3
